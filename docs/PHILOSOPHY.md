## 1. One language for Frontend/Backend/Database - **TypeScript**

...best programming language on the market 🚀

## 2 Rock solid frameworks as foundation

TypeScript, Angular, NodeJs, RxJS, NgRx, TypeOrm, ExpressJs ..⭐

## 3. **Never** ever **repeat** single line of **code**

.. only possible with isomorphic code ✅

## 4. Strongly Typed Frontend/Backend/Database

...imagine changing an entity property, and as a result,<br>
Angular template variables are automatically refactored! <br>
This is the ultimate way to practice "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) in coding! ✍️

## 5. Everything automatically generated

...forget problems with setup => Taon recreates <br>
every time every crucial framework file/config! ✏️

## 6. Fast/developer-friendly coding in <b>Visual Studio Code</b>

... if you love VSCode => you are going to love it more! 👨‍💻

## 7. Every package available everywhere - shared <b>node_modules</b> for similar projects

...one big npm packages container
(located in: ~/.taon/taon/projects/container-v18) <br>
=> many projects takes megabytes instead gigabytes 🐳<br>
=> instant *node_modules* installation 🕙

## 8. Cloud based projects releases (standalone and organization) to remote serves, npm's

...start complex release processes with one simple command ⚡

## 9. Develop libraries and apps at the same time

...only possible with isomorphic code (shared files between backend/frontend/libraries) 🌟

## 10. NodeJs packages are mixed with proper Angular ivy packages

...ship powerful packages with Frontend and Backend 🤝

## 11. Shared assets inside npm package! (only from **/src/assets/shared**)

...because why not! 💾

## 12. Websql development mode for developing SQL backend/db inside browser

...If browsers are so powerful, why not to write Backend inside them? 🌐 <br>
 TypeORM/Sql.js lets you use browser IndexedDB as proper DB!  🗄️
