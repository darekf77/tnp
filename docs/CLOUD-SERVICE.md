## Cloud-Service

Taon, out of the box, provides users with a local service for easy project/port/domain management and deployment. It also gives an insight into what the real bare-bones Taon Cloud service feels like. Essentially, *Taon Service* is the same as *Taon Cloud*.
<br>
<br>
By default, each Taon command checks if a working and healthy local Taon service is available. If not, a new terminal console inside the system starts with the Taon user-friendly UI console.

**Taon UI Console** – basically, it’s everything you would ever need for deploying and managing your remote projects through SSH. No need for a browser UI, no distractions, security concerns.
